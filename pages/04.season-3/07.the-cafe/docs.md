"The Cafe" is the 24th episode of Seinfeld. The episode was the seventh episode of the show's third season. It aired on November 6, 1991.

## Plot

Jerry, fascinated by an empty and failing eclectic restaurant called "The Dream Café," offers his patronage to the restaurant, and convinces its owner, Babu Bhatt (Brian George), to restyle his menu and decor. He suggests that Babu make his restaurant the only authentic Pakistani eatery in the neighborhood. Unfortunately, the restaurant still lacks customers and Babu loses a lot of money. He becomes very upset with Jerry and blames him for causing his failure, yelling, "You're a very, very bad man!", waving his index finger.

Elaine takes an IQ test for George, who is worried that his girlfriend, Monica, who has asked him to take an IQ test for her education course, will not be impressed with the score he receives. This plan backfires. Elaine takes the test at the Dream Café, which Jerry says is quiet, but is distracted by Jerry (who gets her to order food) and then by Kramer (curious about the test), and so performs poorly with an indicated IQ of 85. Elaine insists that she try again and finally, George begrudgingly agrees. This time, Elaine takes the test at Jerry's apartment and does very well, but just as she's about to leave, Kramer locks himself in with her in Jerry's apartment to escape his mother's ex-boyfriend for not returning a jacket he found. Elaine is too late to return the test to George when Monica finds out. At the end of the episode Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer are standing on the same block as where the Dream Café used to be. Elaine learned her IQ was 151 from George's "second try", Kramer loses his jacket, and the Dream Café is shut down.

On the sidewalk Jerry says he's in the mood for Mexican food, George says he's in the mood for Italian, and Elaine says she's in the mood for Chinese. After this, Jerry says, "You know what would be great?" — implying it would be great to have an eclectic restaurant such as the Dream Café around — and George and Elaine give him a long look.
