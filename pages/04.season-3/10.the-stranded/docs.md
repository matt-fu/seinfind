[TOC]

"The Stranded" is the 27th episode of the sitcom Seinfeld. It is the tenth episode of the show's third season. It first aired on November 27, 1991. The episode was originally produced for Season 2 but was postponed because Larry David was dissatisfied with the episode;[1] it was therefore advertised as a "lost" episode. It was also released in the first and second season set instead of the third.

The episode was written by Larry David, Jerry Seinfeld and Matt Goldman and was directed by Tom Cherones. Besides the usual cast, other actors in the episode include: Michael Chiklis, Bobbi Jo Lathan, Gwen Shepherd, and Marcia Firesten.

## Plot

The episode begins with Jerry and George at a drug store to purchase medicine where George becomes involved in an altercation with the cashier (played by Gwen Shepherd), accusing her of short-changing him ten dollars. He is removed by the security guard. George gets invited to a party on Long Island and brings Elaine and Jerry with him. Jerry and Elaine have a bad time trapped in boring conversations, and Elaine confronts a woman because of her fur coat. At one point during the party, Elaine does a mock Australian accent from the film A Cry in the Dark and exclaims "Maybe the dingo ate your baby?"

When a co-worker starts coming on to George, he strands Jerry and Elaine at the party, leaving them to wait for a very late Kramer. As a sign of gratitude for allowing him and Elaine to wait at his home, Jerry suggests the hosts, Steve (played by Michael Chiklis) and Jenny, stop by his apartment if they are ever in Manhattan.

A week later, to Jerry's surprise, Steve takes him up on his offer just as Jerry is heading out the door. Jerry allows him to wait in the apartment until his return. However, Kramer stops by and he and Steve have a drink and bond. Eventually Steve hires a prostitute to come over to Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George meet at the drug store where they speak about George's coworker, whom he slept with after the party. Then, after Jerry picks a medicine, George puts it in his shirt under his jacket as retribution for the short-changing incident before. The security guard witnesses the whole event and takes him to jail.

Just as Jerry arrives, Steve leaves the apartment without paying the prostitute, who refuses to leave until paid. As Jerry is paying the girl off, cops arrive and he's "busted" for fomenting prostitution. Elaine arrives and prepares to squabble with the prostitute over her fur coat. In the final scene Jerry and George fondly reminisce about their time in jail.

## Production

The episode was originally produced for the second season. However, Larry David, dissatisfied with the episode, had the episode shelved until midway through season three. Its initial broadcast included a special introduction by Jerry to explain the continuity error of George still working in the real estate business.[citation needed]
