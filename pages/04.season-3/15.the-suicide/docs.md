[TOC]

"The Suicide" is the 32nd episode of the sitcom Seinfeld. It is the 15th episode of the show's third season. It first aired on January 29, 1992, and it marked the first on-screen appearance of Newman, portrayed by Wayne Knight.

## Plot

Elaine needs to fast before an ulcer test, so she tries starving herself three days before the test. After his neighbor Martin (C.E. Grimes) tries to commit suicide and ends up in a coma, Jerry is hit on by his girlfriend, Gina (Gina Gallego), while at the hospital. Elaine and George visit a psychic at her apartment who warns George to cancel his vacation to the Cayman Islands. However, when Elaine rebukes her for smoking while pregnant, the psychic kicks them out before telling George why he should cancel. Terrified, George sells his ticket to Kramer.

Jerry becomes worried when Newman (a fellow resident and friend of Martin's) sees Jerry with Gina. Later, in the comatose Martin's hospital room, Newman hints to Jerry that he will tell Martin what's been going on with Jerry and Gina, while Kramer is in there to tell Martin to give him back his vacuum cleaner. Jerry attempts to buy Newman off with the extra Drake's coffee cake that he has; however, Elaine (now starving without food) takes it and devours it before he can even eat it. Meanwhile, George finds Rula the psychic in another hospital room as she is going into labor. He tries to discover from her the reason why he shouldn't go to the Caymans; however, she is taken away to give birth before she can divulge it. Amidst all the commotion Martin awakens from his coma and Newman promptly tells him everything, resulting in Jerry being choked.

While in the Caymans, Kramer played nude backgammon with Elle Macpherson, one of the models who was there for a shooting of Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue. Upon his return he explains to George that he was mildly stung on the foot by a jellyfish, and theorizes that this is why the psychic didn't want George to go on the trip. George sarcastically agrees. George and Jerry leave to have dinner with Elaine (who had to reschedule her appointment) while Kramer rushes back to call Elle.
