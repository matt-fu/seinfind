[TOC]

"The Limo" is the 19th episode of the third season of the American sitcom Seinfeld (The 36th episode overall). It aired on February 26, 1992.

## Plot

Jerry flies in from Chicago and George arrives to take him home. His car has broken down on the Belt Parkway and the two are stranded at the airport. Jerry points out a limousine chauffeur with a sign for someone named O'Brien. Jerry had seen an O'Brien in Chicago complaining to the airport staff that he had to reach Madison Square Garden. Since the real O'Brien's flight is overbooked and he will not be arriving in New York soon, George tells Jerry that since it is such a long wait to get a cab, they should pose as O'Brien and his colleague and take the limo home. George chooses the first name Colin and assumes the identity of O'Brien, as Jerry makes up the name Dylan Murphy. The chauffeur believes them and lets them into the limo. George asks the chauffeur where he is driving to, who says Madison Square Garden and that he has the four passes. George remembers the Knicks are playing the Bulls that night at MSG, which must be why O'Brien wanted to get there. George and Jerry are both excited at the prospect of seeing Michael Jordan live.

Jerry calls up Elaine and tells her to wait with Kramer for them to pick them up for the game, and also tells her to call him and George by their pseudonyms. Jerry and George congratulate each other, and George stumbles over a quotation: "I see things as they are, and I say no ..." (the quotation he is searching for belongs to George Bernard Shawâ€”"There are those that look at things the way they are, and ask why? I dream of things that never were, and ask why not?"), finally asking Jerry, "what do you say when you see things?"

After the call, Jerry and George learn that two of the people the passes were intended for are still coming. The chauffeur stops and a man, Tim (Peter Krause), and a woman, Eva (Suzanne Snyder), get in with them. George feigns sleep and Jerry introduces himself. Eva and Tim tell Jerry that they are great fans of O'Brien's newsletter and book, The Big Game, neither of which has he heard of. Luckily, the two have never seen a picture of O'Brien and have no way of knowing who George really is.

As Kramer and Elaine wait outside the apartment building, Jerry mentions that they will probably miss the tip-off, and Tim wonders if he means "someone's been tipped off." George, interested about the book he supposedly wrote, asks Eva to describe her view of it. She and Tim cite the book's analysis of something called "the game," all its major players, and how the fate of the world depends on it. Eva mentions that O'Brien is making a speech that night, and George nervously reads a faxed copy of it for the first time. Kramer mentions how strange it is that George and Jerry took a limo when they had the former's car, and wonders why they insist on being called different names.

George reads O'Brien's speech and finds to his and Jerry's dismay that it is full of remarks expounding antisemitism, anti-Zionism and white supremacy. As he continues it, a loud bang is heard outside. Tim pulls out a pistol and exits the car. Eva tells George that she would do anything for him, even die. Tim comes back and says it was just a flat tire. He then adds if someone really were shooting at them, he would be prepared, and pulls out a briefcase of pistols. A news report reveals that Donald O'Brien, head of the regional chapter of the Aryan Union, a high-profile Neo-Nazi organization, is scheduled to make his first public appearance at the Paramount, adjacent to MSG, to deliver the speech at a rally. He is an outspoken Neo-Nazi, admirer of Adolf Hitler, and passionate fascist to the extent of denouncement from David Duke. Crowd control officers have lined up several barricades to keep away hordes of protesters.

On the street, Kramer and Elaine run into her friend Dan and his friends, who tell them they are going to the Nazi rally to protest O'Brien. He then mentions no one knows what O'Brien looks like. As George explains to Jerry that he is attracted to Eva, they plan to have the limo drive back to the Upper West Side and get out when they see Elaine and Kramer, who realizes that Jerry must be the O'Brien at the rally, which explains the limo. As it drives past them, Kramer sees Jerry and shouts, "O'Brien!" This attracts other protesters across the street standing at a bus stop. As Kramer and Elaine dive through the door and they chase the limo down the street, the phone rings. Kramer picks up and hands it to Eva. She listens for a few seconds and tells the others, "It's O'Brien." Tim and Eva pull out their guns and demand that George and Jerry say who they really are, and Jerry and George, and later Elaine, all quickly and nervously attempt to explain themselves at the same time. The car pulls up to the Paramount and the protesters begin rocking it. Dan notices Elaine as one of the passengers, and she awkwardly acknowledges him. George is placed in front of the news teams identified as Donald O'Brien, and the protesters horde around him as he frantically denies being O'Brien and shouts for Jerry.
