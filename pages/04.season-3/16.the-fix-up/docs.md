## Plot

George says that he would never sink to fix-ups, and so resists the efforts of Jerry and Elaine to set him up with Elaine's friend Cynthia (Maggie Wheeler, credited as Maggie Jakobson) absent certainty she meets his (low) intellectual and (high) attractiveness standards. George and Cynthia hit it off and have sex in George's kitchen, which Cynthia finds painful and uncomfortable, which is why she later is not returning his phone calls. Elaine and Jerry have a "Pact" beforehand that they will share all stories they hear from each with the other, while they promise the dating couple they will hold their private stories secret. Thus, Cynthia tells Elaine about the kitchen discomfort, but Elaine does not tell it to Jerry. Later, Jerry suspects that Elaine has not told him all from Cynthia and they get into a physical fight during which Kramer is forced to separate them.

A few days later, Cynthia tells Elaine she has missed her period. At the same time, George hears from Kramer that the condoms he gave him were defective. When Elaine adds that Cynthia missed her period, George is overjoyed to find out that he is able to get a woman pregnant, and runs to Cynthia to promise to help with the kid in any way he can. She tells him she already got her period. But due to his actions, they make up and become a couple.

The end of the episode sees George, Elaine, Jerry and Cynthia sitting down for dinner at a restaurant, George and Cynthia as a couple, but at the end Cynthia seems disgusted by George's poor table manners.
