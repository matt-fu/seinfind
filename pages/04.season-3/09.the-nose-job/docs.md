## Plot

George thinks his girlfriend Audrey (Susan Diol) is perfect, except for one flaw: she has a large nose. During a conversation about beautiful women, Kramer bluntly tells her she needs a nose job. Meanwhile, Jerry is conflicted about his relationship with an actress (Tawny Kitaen), whom he finds beautiful but absolutely dumb and despicable.

Audrey gets persuaded to get a nose job, and as Kramer said she "got butchered". George faints, and Kramer rushes her to the hospital to be taken care of. In the meanwhile, George finds her disfigured nose even more untasteful, and she ends the relationship.

Kramer needs Elaine's help in reacquiring a jacket that supposedly has an attractive power over women. To get the jacket, he wants Elaine to pretend to be his fiancee and go to the place where the jacket is, to pretend she is the daughter of the owner and get it.

Once Kramer blatantly tells Audrey she needs a nose job, Elaine - in disgust - refuses to help him. But once he helps Audrey to the hospital, Elaine relents and goes with him to get the jacket.

Eventually, Audrey's nose gets fixed with Kramer's help, and he is seen with the magical jacket going out with Audrey.
