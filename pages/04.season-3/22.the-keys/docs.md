[TOC]

"The Keys" is the 40th episode of the sitcom Seinfeld. It is the 23rd, and final, episode of the third season and the first of a three-episode cliffhanger. It first aired on May 6, 1992. Candice Bergen guest stars as Murphy Brown, the title character from the eponymous sitcom.

## Plot

In a montage of incidents, Jerry returns home only to find that Kramer has overstayed his welcome; he had been using the spare set of keys Jerry had left with him. Exasperated, Jerry demands his spare keys back, angering Kramer. Knowing that he has broken the "covenant of the keys", Kramer realizes he is now free to come out of the shadows. Kramer then takes off for California to follow his dream of becoming an actor, after he is unable to persuade George to join him.

Jerry gives his spare keys to Elaine. Soon after, he desperately needs them and goes to Elaine's apartment with George (who has the spare keys to her place), to search for his spare set. While there, they find Elaine's writing project for an episode of Murphy Brown. As they read and laugh over it, Elaine walks in and screams at them to leave because they've invaded her privacy.

Jerry is unable to locate Kramer to make amends. One night, while watching Murphy Brown with Elaine, Jerry sees Kramer in a famous bit part on Murphy Brown as Murphy's new secretary, "Steven Snell". Surprisingly, Murphy tells Steven that she has "a very good feeling" about him.

At various points in the show, a recurring incident involves Elaine and George each muttering disparaging remarks (including profanity) to Jerry under their breath in conversation with him. When Jerry asks them to repeat what they said, they both deny that they said anything.

## Production

Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld later appeared on Diane English's (creator of Murphy Brown) new show, Love & War, as a thank you for the Murphy Brown scene.

## Music

When Jerry calls Kramer's mother, the music heard in the background is from Pagliacci, which was later featured in the episode "The Opera". The scene that shows Kramer rollerskating in L.A. is accompanied by an instrumental version of The Beach Boys' song "California Girls".
