[TOC]

"The Truth" is the 19th episode of Seinfeld. It is the second episode of the show's third season, first airing on September 25, 1991. Directed by David Steinberg, this is the first episode of the show (other than the pilot) not directed by Tom Cherones.

## Plot

In 1985, Kramer manages to convince Jerry to donate to a fake relief fund for the Krakatoa eruption (which actually erupted in 1883, 102 years earlier).

In the present day, Jerry is now being audited by the IRS as a result of the fraudulent fund. George gives Jerry's tax papers to his girlfriend Patrice (played by Valerie Mahaffey), an accountant and former representative for the IRS, but has trouble getting around her strange pronunciation habits. George tells the truth to Patrice and they promptly break up, a move that upsets Jerry, as she took the tax papers with her, with no way of retrieving them.

Meanwhile, Elaine gets tired of Kramer dating her roommate Tina (played by Siobhan Fallon), because of the messy kitchen, the loud African tribal music, and a windshield (which Kramer had found on the side of the road) that he used as a coffee table. The conflict between them comes to a head when Kramer unknowingly walks into Elaine's bedroom and sees her naked. Eventually, Kramer and Tina accidentally break the windshield coffee table during a make-out session, severely injuring them and leading to Tina being admitted to hospital.

Upon learning that Patrice checked into a depression clinic (described as a "mental institution" by George), Jerry and George go to visit her. When George introduces her to Jerry, she recognizes him as "the Jerome with the tax problems." She reveals to them that after she left George, she got upset and threw out Jerry's tax papers. Unfortunately, Jerry never made copies of the many receipts that he had collected over the years, and the episode ends with him tracking them down individually by phone.
