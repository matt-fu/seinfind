[TOC]

"The Pick" is the 53rd episode of the sitcom Seinfeld. It is the 13th episode of the fourth season, and first aired on December 16, 1992.

## Plot

Elaine is humiliated when her Christmas card photo taken by Kramer accidentally exposes her nipple. Jerry has a date with Tia Van Camp (Jennifer Campbell), the Calvin Klein model he met on the plane in the previous episode. After the date, Kramer discovers that Tia is wearing the perfume he invented in "The Pez Dispenser", which she calls "Ocean".

Tia later dumps Jerry after witnessing him scratching his nose, which she mistakes for him picking his nose. Jerry claims that there was no "nostril penetration". He attempts to explain his actions further at the Calvin Klein office but Tia refuses to believe him, and in an effort to redeem himself Jerry launches into a rant, as onlookers mill around the two of them, about "picking" and having to put up with "shame and humiliation because of people like you!" as if to publicly shame Tia for her prissy demeanor, ending his speech to the gathered crowd with a proud declaration of "I am not an animal!"

Meanwhile, George visits a therapist to discuss a problem with his girlfriend Susan, but the session is unproductive as first George, and then also the therapist, obsess over the stuck zipper on George's jacket. George later reunites with Susan only to realize it was a mistake, so he uses "the pick" to escape. Kramer meets with Calvin Klein (Nicholas Hormann) to complain about "The Ocean", and is instead asked to pose for a risqu√© underwear advertisement, where his genitals are accidentally exposed.

## Production

Newman appears in this episode for only 13 seconds when Jerry brings him in and asks if Elaine's nipple is visible in her Christmas card photo. The original title for this episode was supposed to be "The Nipple", but Larry David thought that this would be too sexually explicit for network television.

This episode makes no mention of George finding himself on a flight heading out of New York at the end of the previous episode, "The Airport"; where he went or how he got back is not explained.

In a scene where Elaine is at work discussing the picture with Fred, Larry David makes a brief cameo appearance as the voice of an office worker leaning into Elaine's office and asking if she's done with a manuscript, while addressing her as "Nip".[1]
