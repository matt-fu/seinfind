## Plot

George is not looking forward to telling Susan's parents that her father's cabin was destroyed by fire (by Kramer, with Cuban cigars Susan's father gave to George). Jerry suggests that the Rosses are likely to see the irony of the situation.

Jerry and George struggle with their sitcom pilot script. Jerry telephones Elaine and complains to her about her chatty secretary, Sandra (Lisa Malkiewicz), and Elaine asks Sandra not to talk to Jerry so much. Annoyed, Sandra quits. At Jerry's apartment, Kramer asks George for more Cuban cigars to bribe his way onto the Westchester Country Club golf course. George has none, so Kramer leaves to find some.

That night, George has an awkward dinner with Susan and her parents (Warren Frost and Grace Zabriskie). Susan and George eventually tell her father about the loss of the cabin, and he asks if anything was recovered.

Elaine asks Jerry to apologize to Sandra, to keep her from quitting. Jerry does so, and arranges a date with Sandra that night. They return to his apartment, but Sandra storms off after they begin talking dirty and Jerry goes too far. The next day Jerry tells George that he said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?", and this led to Sandra storming out. George and Jerry then doze off after failing to write any more of their script. Elaine thanks Jerry for getting Sandra back to work, but Jerry says she should relocate her quickly and is relieved that Sandra did not mention the previous night.

Kramer asks the Cuban diplomatic mission at the United Nations about buying Cuban cigars, and learns that they are illegal in the United States. However, the chief diplomat (Miguel Perez) likes Kramer's jacket and they reach an understanding.

Jerry and George go to Susan's house to return her sunglasses. A doorman delivers her family a metal box from the insurance company, the only object which survived the cabin fire. Inside are letters detailing an affair between Susan's father and novelist John Cheever. Susan reads one aloud before her father enters the room and snatches the box. He describes Cheever as "the most wonderful person" he has ever known, and says that he "loved him deeplyâ€”in a way that you wouldn't understand!" Jerry and George slip out the door, leaving the stunned family.

They again fail to progress with the script before they are interrupted by Elaine, who is angry with Jerry because her company charged her $429 for making phone calls to Europe from work; after she was transferred, Elaine's former secretary turned her in. Jerry gladly gives Elaine the money, and as she leaves she reveals that Sandra told her about her night with Jerry: "Maybe I should go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties, and they're all (mock-seductively) laid out for me."
