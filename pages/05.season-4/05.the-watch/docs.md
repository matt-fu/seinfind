[TOC]

"The Watch" is the 46th episode of the sitcom Seinfeld. It is the sixth episode of the fourth season of the series, and first aired on September 30, 1992.

## Plot

Jerry has dinner with his parents and Uncle Leo. Elaine uses Kramer as "her boyfriend" in trying to fool her psychiatrist, Dr. Reston, who she was dating (played by Stephen McHattie). George gets Russell Dalrymple's address and tries to get the pilot reinstated. He succeeds -- at a price lower than Russell's original offer. Jerry tries to buy back the watch from Uncle Leo. Outside her psychiatrist's office, Elaine meets "Crazy" Joe Davola, whom she begins to date.

This episode is a continuation of and opens with clips from the previous episode, "The Wallet."
