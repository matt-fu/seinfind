[TOC]

"The Wallet" is the 45th episode of the sitcom Seinfeld. It is the fifth episode of the fourth season of the series, and first aired on September 23, 1992.

## Plot

When Jerry's parents come to town to see a back specialist, they hear about "Crazy" Joe Davola not liking Jerry and ask about the watch they gave him. George "negotiates" the deal with the NBC and gets a box of cigars from Susan Ross's father. While at the doctor's office Morty's wallet is "stolen". Elaine returns from her trip and tries to end her relationship with her shrink (Stephen McHattie). The deal with NBC is lost.

"The Wallet" is Part 1 of an episode pairing and continues into "The Watch" which is Part 2 and aired the following week.

## Production

This was the first episode in the fourth season to include Elaine in a major role. Julia Louis-Dreyfus was pregnant for part of the third season and was absent in "The Trip" and only had cameo appearances in "The Pitch" and "The Ticket". The plot line of her in Europe and the guys in California was to accommodate her absence. Elaine receives applause from the audience when she enters. Kramer is the only other character of the main four to get applauded.

## Episode connections

The wallet was later revealed to be in Jerry's couch in "The Pilot, Part 2".

The box of cigars given to George by Susan's father, which George in turn gives to Kramer, is the same box of cigars that burns down the cabin in "The Bubble Boy". The story of the cigars continues on and is a central part of the story in "The Cheever Letters".
