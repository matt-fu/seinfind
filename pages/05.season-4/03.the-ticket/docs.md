[TOC]

"The Ticket" is the 44th episode of the sitcom Seinfeld. It was the 4th episode of the fourth season. It aired on September 16, 1992 as a one-hour episode with The Pitch. That version is available on the Season 4 box set.

## Plot

Continuing from "The Pitch", as a result of a blow on the head by Crazy Joe Davola, Kramer starts suffering from hemispatial neglect: He forgets to dress/shave half of his body properly, and utters gibberish (a trait that would continue for the rest of the series). While all this is occurring, Elaine is in Europe with her therapist (Stephen McHattie). NBC gives Jerry and George another meeting about their idea for a pilot and on the way, Jerry throws out a watch his parents gave him, saying it is always running slow. He then meets his Uncle Leo, who picks the watch out of the garbage after Jerry and George leave. Kramer agrees to be an alibi for Newman's trial on a speeding ticket - Newman was simply racing home to stop Kramer, despondent over never becoming a banker, from committing suicide. Once in court, however, Kramer experiences short-term memory loss due to his head injury and completely forgets about their agreed-to alibi, causing Newman's case to crumble. This particular episode is noteworthy in that it showcases the high-comedy exchange between the Newman and Kramer characters much in the tradition of classic duos such as Laurel and Hardy, or Abbott and Costello.

George and Jerry meet with NBC executives and they give the go ahead for a pilot. Afterwards Jerry and George go to the coffee shop. While there, Jerry calls his manager to find out that NBC has offered them $13,000 for the pilot. George is insulted by this. He then glances out the window and thinks he sees Crazy Joe Davola outside. This makes Jerry and George afraid to leave the cafe. Jerry attempts to enlist the help of a policeman in getting out; however, the policeman decides to order a sandwich and refuses to escort them out until he has eaten. Elaine's psychiatrist realizes that he did not leave an extra prescription for Joe Davola for the time while he would be on vacation, thus explaining Joe's imbalanced behavior.
